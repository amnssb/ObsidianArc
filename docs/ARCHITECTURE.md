# Obsidian Arc — Server Architecture

The plan for turning the current standalone, bring-your-own-key chat surface
into a self-hosted, multi-user AI chat server, without losing the product it
already is.

The governing constraint is stated once here and applies to every decision
below: **this is a small program**. A single Go binary with an embedded
frontend, one database, no sidecars, no Python, no broker, no cache tier. If
two designs do the same job, the one with fewer moving parts wins.

---

## 1. What is here today

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | Vanilla JavaScript, no framework, no bundler, no build step |
| Module system | 8 UMD-style scripts attached to `globalThis`, loaded by `<script>` tags |
| Styling | 2 hand-written stylesheets driven by `--ai-*` CSS custom properties |
| State | In-memory closures; persistence to `localStorage` through a `chrome.storage.local`-shaped adapter |
| Networking | The browser calls Anthropic / OpenAI-compatible endpoints directly, with the user's own key |
| Dev server | `python -m http.server` |
| Dependencies | None. Zero runtime deps, zero dev deps |
| Tests / lint / types | None |

| File | Lines | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/chat.js` | 1013 | The chat surface: rail, transcript, composer, streaming, editing, attachments |
| `src/provider.js` | 804 | Anthropic + OpenAI-compatible clients, SSE parsing, config, key encryption |
| `src/workspace.js` | 796 | Header bar (model chip, theme, settings) + settings drawer |
| `src/markdown.js` | 435 | XSS-safe Markdown renderer that never touches `innerHTML` |
| `src/store.js` | 255 | Conversation model, normalization, caps |
| `src/color-utils.js` | 140 | Accent-color light/dark contrast math |
| `src/adapters.js` | 94 | `localStorage` storage shim |
| `src/image.js` | 76 | Client-side image downscale before attachment |
| `src/chat.css` | 1160 | Design tokens + the entire chat visual language |
| `src/workspace.css` | 534 | Header, chip menu, drawer, form controls, color picker |

### The important structural fact

`chat.js` already has exactly the seam this migration needs. It knows nothing
about providers. Its host hands it two functions:

```js
getStatus()  // -> { configured, vision, streaming }
send({ turns, signal, onReply, onThinking })  // -> { reply, thinking, stats, ... }
```

`workspace.js` is the reference host that implements those against
`provider.js`. Swapping "the browser calls Anthropic with the user's key" for
"the browser calls our server, which calls Anthropic with the admin's key" is
a **replacement of that host**, not a rewrite of the chat. The design language
survives because the file that draws it is barely touched.

---

## 2. UI architecture worth naming

These are the things that make the product feel the way it does. Every one of
them is preserved.

- **Layout** — a rounded 18px container per surface; a 260px conversation rail
  that slides out by negative margin (contents never reflow mid-animation);
  a single 680px reading column centred in the transcript.
- **Message shape** — the user's words in a violet bubble with an asymmetric
  `16px 16px 4px 16px` radius; the assistant's set as plain prose on the page,
  so a long answer reads as a document rather than a chat log.
- **Reasoning** — a quiet `<details>` with a left rule, auto-scrolled while
  live, collapsed once done.
- **Stats line** — the quietest thing in the message: duration, streamed /
  one-shot, first-token latency, token counts, tok/s.
- **Composer** — a 26px pill on `--ai-surface-container-high`, attach button
  on the left, send/stop morphing on the right, focus ring on the whole pill.
- **Model selector** — a header chip that opens a menu of `title` + `sub`
  rows, with a "manage models" footer that jumps to settings.
- **Settings** — a right-side drawer, 420px, sections separated by uppercase
  subheads, with an accent picker of 10 dots plus a custom hex row.
- **Motion** — `aiChatSwitch` on conversation change and on a just-sent
  message, a caret that blinks at the live end of a streaming answer, a
  0.34s `cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)` rail slide, and a full
  `prefers-reduced-motion` path that turns all of it off.
- **Theme** — light values on `:root`, dark by `prefers-color-scheme`, forced
  by `[data-theme]`; one accent hue clamped per scheme by `color-utils.js` so
  a single pick stays readable on both white and near-black, and tinted into
  `--ai-state-hover` so the whole interface reads as being *in* that color.

---

## 3. Keep / refactor / rewrite

### Keep, essentially verbatim

| What | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `chat.css`, `workspace.css` | This *is* the design language. Ported to the new build unchanged except for new selectors. |
| `markdown.js` | Genuinely good: token tree + `createElement`, no `innerHTML` path, images downgraded to links, `javascript:` links rendered as text. Retype as TS, keep the logic. |
| `color-utils.js` | Small, correct, and the reason one hue works in both schemes. |
| `image.js` | Client-side downscale is still wanted — it now saves upload bandwidth and server storage instead of `localStorage` quota. |
| `chat.js` render + interaction code | Transcript rendering, editing, regenerate, streaming fast-path, drag/drop, attachments strip, empty state, suggestion chips. |
| `workspace.js` header + drawer chrome | Chip menu, drawer open/close, field/checkbox helpers, accent grid. |

### Refactor

| What | Into what |
| --- | --- |
| `store.js` persistence | Same in-memory conversation shape, but backed by the server API instead of `localStorage`. The normalization caps move server-side, where they belong. |
| `chat.js` state | Still a closure, but with the storage/`persist()` calls replaced by an injected `ConversationStore` port. Its ~15 mutable locals stay — a full re-render of a 680px column is cheap and the `updatePending()` fast-path already handles the streaming case. |
| `provider.js` | Split. The *logic* (message building, adjacent-role merging, `<think>` splitting, SSE framing, usage extraction, error explanation) is ported to Go as the provider adapters. The *browser-side* remnant is a thin SSE client against our own API. |
| `workspace.js` settings drawer | Sections re-scoped: API key / base URL / provider move to Admin; profile, default model, default reasoning, wallpaper move in. |
| `adapters.js` | Shrinks to a preferences shim (theme, accent, wallpaper) — chat history no longer lives in `localStorage`. |
| Global `<script>` + `globalThis` modules | ES modules + TypeScript, bundled by Vite, embedded into the Go binary. |

### Delete

- The direct-to-provider network path and everything that supports it:
  `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access`, the AES-GCM key-at-rest toggle,
  the "detect models" call from the browser (moves to Admin, server-side).
- `python -m http.server` as the dev server and `npm start`.
- The `localStorage` conversation store and its size caps.

```

**Modular monolith.** One process, one binary, one database. Modules are Go
packages with an explicit surface, not services. A module owns its tables and
exposes a `Service` struct; other modules depend on the interface they need,
declared on the consumer side.

No Redis, no queue, no worker pool, no cron daemon. The only background
goroutines are: `http.Server`'s own, and a single janitor ticking every 10
minutes to expire sessions and drop stale quota buckets.

### Directory layout

```
cmd/server/main.go            flags/env → wire → serve → graceful shutdown
internal/
  config/      Config struct from env + flags, one source of truth
  database/    open(sqlite|postgres), dialect rebind, tx helper, migrations/*.sql (embedded)
  httpx/       ServeMux wiring, middleware, JSON + SSE helpers, typed errors
  auth/        argon2id, sessions, register/login/logout, RequireUser / RequireAdmin
  user/        user store + service, self-profile handlers
  group/       groups, model permissions, per-group quota policy
  provider/    provider CRUD, API-key encryption, upstream model listing
  model/       model CRUD, capabilities, credit weights, per-user visible list
  adapter/     unified ChatRequest/Event + openai.go + anthropic.go + registry
  chat/        the gateway: permission → quota → adapter → stream → persist → ledger
  conversation/ conversations, messages, attachments (all user-scoped)
  usage/       ledger writes + aggregation queries
  quota/       policy resolution (global→group→user), atomic counters, enforcement
  settings/    global key/value settings
  admin/       admin-only handlers over the modules above
  web/         embed.FS of the built frontend + SPA fallback
web/           Vite + TypeScript frontend source
```

Handlers live with their module. There is no `handlers/` dump and no
`repository/service/usecase/entity` ladder — a module is
`store.go` (SQL), `service.go` (rules), `http.go` (transport), `types.go`.

### Dependencies

Go, direct:

| Module | For | Why this one |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `modernc.org/sqlite` | SQLite driver | Pure Go: no cgo, static binary, trivial cross-compile. Behind a `nosqlite` build tag for Postgres-only builds. |
| `github.com/jackc/pgx/v5` | Postgres driver | The standard, and its `stdlib` shim keeps everything on `database/sql`. |
| `golang.org/x/crypto` | argon2id | Official. |

That is the whole list. Routing is `net/http`'s `ServeMux` (Go 1.22 method +
wildcard patterns). Migrations are a 60-line runner over an `embed.FS`. No
ORM, no query builder, no logging framework (`log/slog` is in the standard
library), no config library.

Frontend runtime dependencies: **zero**. Build dependencies: `vite`,
`typescript`.

### Performance targets, and what was measured

| | Target | Measured |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Idle resident memory (SQLite, no traffic) | < 30 MB | ~16 MB |
| Cold start to serving | < 100 ms | 28 ms |
| Binary (SQLite + embedded SPA) | < 30 MB | 16.9 MB (13.3 MB `-tags nosqlite`) |
| Frontend, on the wire | < 80 kB | 68.6 kB to open the chat (53.3 JS + 14.3 CSS) |
| Background goroutines at idle | 1 | 1 |
| Under load, 200 streamed turns at 20 concurrent | — | ~54 MB peak, 11 OS threads |

It was 89.0 kB and over the target until the three pieces most people never
need were split off it: the administration backoffice, the Chinese dictionary,
and the LaTeX renderer. What each reader actually downloads:

| | gzipped |
| --- | --- |
| English, not an administrator | 58.7 kB |
| Chinese, not an administrator | 71.1 kB |
| …and a conversation containing a formula | 74.8 kB |
| Chinese administrator, backoffice open | 92.4 kB |

Only the last is heavier than the single bundle was, and only once the
backoffice has actually been opened — the first paint is 71.1 kB either way.
The stylesheet is not split: `admin.css` carries the shared design system —
panels, fields, tables, the About screen — and separating the part that is
genuinely admin-only is a different, more careful job.

These are transferred sizes. The server compresses its own responses, because
the deployment this document assumes has nothing in front of it to do that
instead: 136 kB of JavaScript leaves as 47, and 70 kB of CSS as 13. The
allowlist in `httpx.Compress` is what keeps the event stream out of it — a
streamed answer pushed through a compressor arrives when the buffer fills
rather than when the model produced a word, and nothing in any log would say
so.

Connection pools: SQLite 4, Postgres 10. Neither is a bottleneck at this
scale — a turn spends its time waiting on a provider, not on the database.

---

## 5. Database schema

Portable between SQLite and PostgreSQL by construction:

- **IDs are `TEXT`** — ULIDs generated in Go. Lexicographically sortable, so
  `ORDER BY id` is chronological and index-friendly; no `SERIAL` vs
  `AUTOINCREMENT` split, and no enumerable integers to walk in an IDOR probe.
- **Timestamps are `BIGINT`** — Unix epoch milliseconds. Identical semantics
  in both engines, and window queries are plain integer comparisons.
- **Booleans are `BOOLEAN`** (SQLite stores 0/1; the driver handles it).
- **Money-ish values are `DOUBLE PRECISION` / `REAL`** for credits.
- No engine-specific types, no `JSONB`, no arrays. JSON payloads are `TEXT`.

Migrations are numbered `.sql` files applied in order inside a transaction,
tracked in `schema_migrations`. Nothing mutates schema at boot beyond running
pending migrations.

### Tables

```
users                id, username, username_lower*, email, email_lower*,
                     password_hash, nickname, avatar, bio, role, group_id,
                     status, created_at, updated_at, last_login_at
sessions             id (= sha256 of the cookie token), user_id, created_at,
                     expires_at, last_seen_at, ip, user_agent
groups               id, name*, description, is_default, allow_all_models,
                     sort_order, created_at, updated_at

quota_policies       id, scope ('global'|'group'|'user'), scope_id,
                     rpm, tpm,
                     window_5h_enabled, window_5h_requests,
                       window_5h_tokens, window_5h_credits,
                     window_1w_… , window_1m_… ,
                     updated_at                                UNIQUE(scope, scope_id)
providers            id, name, kind ('openai'|'anthropic'), base_url,
                     api_key_enc (BLOB), api_key_hint, headers_json,
                     anthropic_version, reasoning_style, timeout_seconds,
                     enabled, sort_order, created_at, updated_at
models               id, provider_id→providers, model_id, display_name,
                     description, avatar, enabled, sort_order,
                     supports_reasoning, supports_images, supports_vision,
                     supports_streaming, supports_system_prompt, supports_tools,
                     context_window, max_output_tokens,
                     request_weight, input_token_weight,
                     output_token_weight, reasoning_token_weight,
                     created_at, updated_at        UNIQUE(provider_id, model_id)
conversations        id, user_id, title, model_id, pinned,
                     created_at, updated_at, deleted_at
messages             id, conversation_id, user_id, seq, role, content,
                     reasoning, error, model_id, provider_id,
                     stats_json, created_at       UNIQUE(conversation_id, seq)
attachments          id, user_id, message_id, kind, mime, width, height,
                     size, data (BLOB), created_at
usage_records        id, user_id, group_id, provider_id, model_id, model_ref,
                     conversation_id, message_id, request_id*,
                     input_tokens, output_tokens, reasoning_tokens,
                     total_tokens, credits, status, error_code,
                     started_at, finished_at, duration_ms
usage_counters       scope_key, window_kind, window_start,
                     requests, tokens, credits     PK(scope_key, window_kind, window_start)
settings             key, value, updated_at
user_preferences     user_id, data (JSON TEXT), updated_at
```

`*` = unique index.

Indexes that matter: `usage_records(user_id, started_at)`,
`usage_records(model_id, started_at)`, `messages(conversation_id, seq)`,
`conversations(user_id, updated_at DESC)`, `sessions(expires_at)`.

### Notes on specific choices

- **`username_lower` / `email_lower`** rather than `CITEXT` — Postgres-only
  types would break SQLite parity.
- **Attachments as BLOB in the database.** One database is the whole
  deployment story; an object store is a second thing to run. Images are
  already downscaled client-side to under a megabyte, and the read path is a
  single ownership-checked row fetch. The store is behind a
  `BlobStore` interface, so an S3/disk backend later is one implementation,
  not a migration.
- **`supports_images` vs `supports_vision`** are both kept as requested:
  `supports_images` = the endpoint accepts image parts in the request;
  `supports_vision` = the model actually reasons over them. The composer
  enables attachments on the first; the model list badges the second.
- **`reasoning_style`** on the provider is what keeps the reasoning
  translation out of the gateway (see §6).

---

## 6. Provider adapter

One request shape in, one event stream out. The gateway never learns a
provider's name.

```go
package adapter

type ChatRequest struct {
	Model       ModelSpec   // upstream id + capabilities + limits
	System      string
	Messages    []Message   // Role + []Part{Text|Image}
	Temperature *float64
	MaxTokens   int
	Reasoning   Reasoning   // { Enabled bool; Effort "low"|"medium"|"high" }
	Stream      bool
	Extra       map[string]any
}

type Event struct {
	Type  EventType // Delta | ReasoningDelta | Usage | Done | Error
	Text  string
	Usage *Usage    // Input/Output/ReasoningTokens
	Err   error
}

type Adapter interface {
	Kind() string
	Chat(ctx context.Context, p Provider, req ChatRequest, sink func(Event) error) (Result, error)
	ListModels(ctx context.Context, p Provider) ([]RemoteModel, error)
}

var registry = map[string]Adapter{"openai": openAI{}, "anthropic": anthropic{}}
```

The gateway does `registry[provider.Kind].Chat(...)`. There is no
`if kind == "openai"` anywhere outside `internal/adapter`.

### Reasoning translation

The frontend only ever sends `{ enabled, effort }`. Each adapter turns that
into whatever its wire format wants, selected by the provider's
`reasoning_style` so a new upstream quirk is a config value, not a code
branch:

| `reasoning_style` | Emitted |
| --- | --- |
| `anthropic` | `thinking: {type: "enabled", budget_tokens: N}`, N from effort (2048 / 8192 / 24576), clamped below `max_tokens`; temperature omitted, which the API requires |
| `openai_effort` | `reasoning_effort: "low"\|"medium"\|"high"` |
| `openrouter` | `reasoning: {effort: "..."}` |
| `qwen` | `enable_thinking: true` |
| `none` | nothing; the model reasons or does not on its own |

Reasoning **output** arrives in three shapes, all normalised to
`ReasoningDelta` events: Anthropic's `thinking_delta`, the
`reasoning` / `reasoning_content` fields OpenAI-compatible servers have
settled on, and inline `<think>…</think>` at the head of the content. The
third needs a splitter that tolerates a stream stopping mid-tag — the
existing `splitThinking()` in `provider.js` already does this correctly and
is ported to Go as-is.

Reasoning and answer are stored in separate columns (`messages.reasoning`,
`messages.content`).

### What else moves from `provider.js` into Go

- Endpoint resolution from a partial base URL (`…`, `…/v1`, `…/v1/messages`).
- Base-URL validation: https only, except loopback; no embedded credentials.
- Adjacent same-role merging and leading-assistant trimming (an edited
  transcript can produce either, and both providers reject it).
- Image de-duplication across turns, so a picture attached three turns ago is
  sent once.
- Usage extraction (`input_tokens`/`output_tokens` vs
  `prompt_tokens`/`completion_tokens`, plus `x_groq.usage`).
- Error explanation: an auth failure names the provider and URL it was sent
  to; an image rejection on 400/415/422 says the model probably cannot read
  images rather than quoting the wire error.

---

## 7. Chat, streaming, cancellation

```
POST /api/chat            (SSE response)
  { conversation_id?, model_id, content, attachment_ids[],
    reasoning: {enabled, effort}, regenerate_from_message_id? }
```

1. `RequireUser` → the session's user; `status = 'disabled'` is rejected here.
2. Resolve the model **and** check the user's group may use it. The frontend's
   model list is a convenience; this check is the authority.
3. `quota.Reserve` — atomic, see §9. A rejection is a `429` carrying which
   window tripped and when it resets.
4. Load the transcript (`WHERE conversation_id = ? AND user_id = ?`), append
   the user message, create the conversation if this is the first turn.
5. `adapter.Chat` with `ctx` derived from `r.Context()`.
6. Frames are written to the client as they arrive and flushed immediately:
   `message_start`, `delta`, `reasoning`, `usage`, `done`, `error`.
7. On completion **or** cancellation: persist the assistant message, write the
   usage ledger row, settle the quota reservation.

**Stopping** is the client closing the stream. That cancels `r.Context()`,
which cancels the outbound `http.Request`, which closes the upstream
connection — the provider stops generating and stops billing. No stop
endpoint, no request registry, no shared state. Step 7 runs on
`context.WithoutCancel(ctx)` so a cancelled turn still saves the partial
answer the user read and still records the tokens it cost.

SSE rather than WebSocket: the traffic is one-directional, it survives every
proxy unchanged, and cancellation is just closing the connection.

The client uses `fetch` + a `ReadableStream` reader rather than `EventSource`,
because the request is a POST. The SSE frame parser already written in
`provider.js` (including `\r\n\r\n` framing for proxies that rewrite line
endings) is reused verbatim.

Timeouts: `ResponseHeaderTimeout` on the upstream client, plus a per-provider
overall deadline. `WriteTimeout` on our own server is disabled for the SSE
route and enforced per-request instead, so a long generation is not cut off.

---

## 8. Usage ledger

One row per AI request, written once, never updated after settlement:

```
user_id, group_id, provider_id, model_id, model_ref, conversation_id,
message_id, request_id, input_tokens, output_tokens, reasoning_tokens,
total_tokens, credits, status, error_code, started_at, finished_at, duration_ms
```

`status` ∈ `ok | error | aborted | rejected`. An aborted turn is recorded
with the tokens it actually consumed; a quota rejection is recorded with
zeros, which is what makes "why did my request fail" answerable later.

Credits:

```
credits = request_weight
        + input_tokens     × input_token_weight     / 1000
        + output_tokens    × output_token_weight    / 1000
        + reasoning_tokens × reasoning_token_weight / 1000
```

Weights live on the model row, so a 0.2× model and a 3× model share one user
allowance. The first release can leave every weight at 1 and nothing about
the schema or the query path has to change to start using them.

Every aggregate the admin UI shows — per user, per model, per provider, per
window — is a `GROUP BY` over this table. There is no denormalised
`used_tokens` column anywhere to drift out of sync.

---

## 9. Quota

### Policy resolution

```
global default  →  user's group  →  user override      (last non-NULL wins)
```

Every field is nullable at each level; `NULL` means inherit. `*_enabled = 0`
at any level means that window is off for this user. Admins bypass
enforcement by default (a setting).

Windows are fixed and calendar-aligned so "when does this reset" has an
answer the UI can show: 5h buckets aligned to the epoch, weeks to Monday
00:00 UTC, months to the 1st.

### Atomicity

The forbidden shape is `read → check → increment`. Instead, a **reservation**
is a single atomic upsert per window:

```sql
INSERT INTO usage_counters (scope_key, window_kind, window_start, requests, tokens, credits)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, 1, 0, 0)
ON CONFLICT (scope_key, window_kind, window_start)
DO UPDATE SET requests = usage_counters.requests + 1
RETURNING requests, tokens, credits;
```

The returned value is post-increment, so the check happens *after* the write:
if it is over the limit, the request is rejected and the increment is undone
in the same transaction. Two concurrent requests cannot both see room that
only one of them has. RPM/TPM use the same table with a 60-second bucket.

Settlement after the response adds the real token and credit totals to the
same rows.

This works identically on SQLite (`ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE … RETURNING`, 3.35+)
and Postgres. `usage_counters` is a cache, not a source of truth: it can be
rebuilt from `usage_records` at any time, and stale buckets are dropped by the
janitor.

Redis is not in this design. It would be introduced only if measurement shows
the counter table is a bottleneck, which for a self-hosted server on a VPS it
will not be.

## 10. Security

| Concern | Handling |
| --- | --- |
| Passwords | Argon2id, `m=19MiB, t=2, p=1` (OWASP floor), with a concurrency semaphore so a login burst cannot spike memory. Tunable in config. |
| Sessions | 32 random bytes in an `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Path=/` cookie. The database stores only its SHA-256, so a database leak is not a session leak. Rotated on login, revoked on logout and on disable. |
| CSRF | `SameSite=Lax` plus an `Origin` / `Sec-Fetch-Site` check on every unsafe method. No token table. |
| IDOR | Ownership is a `WHERE user_id = ?` clause on the query, never a check on the result. Conversations, messages, attachments and usage rows all follow this. |
| Authorization | Every admin route sits behind `RequireAdmin`. Model permission is checked in the gateway, not inferred from what the client asked for. |
| XSS | The markdown renderer builds elements and never produces an HTML string. Plus a strict CSP (`default-src 'self'`, no inline script). |
| SQL injection | `database/sql` placeholders only; a `rebind` helper converts `?` to `$N` for Postgres. No string-concatenated SQL anywhere. |
| Provider keys | AES-256-GCM at rest, key derived by HKDF from `OBSIDIAN_SECRET_KEY`. Never serialised into any response — the admin UI sees `••••1234`. Never logged. |
| Log redaction | A `redact()` helper for anything key-shaped; request bodies are never logged. |
| Input validation | Every handler decodes into a typed struct with explicit bounds; `MaxBytesReader` on all bodies. |
| Rate limiting | Per-IP on `/api/auth/*` (in-memory token bucket), per-user via quota everywhere else. |

Explicitly out of scope for the browser: provider API keys never reach the
HTML, the JS bundle, any network response, or `localStorage`.

## 11. Frontend

TypeScript, built by Vite, output embedded into the Go binary via `embed.FS`
and served with an SPA fallback. No framework runtime.

```
web/src/
  main.ts          boot: session check → route
  router.ts        hash-free history router, ~60 lines
  api/             typed fetch client, SSE reader, error normalisation
  ui/              el/button/icon/field/checkbox/table/dialog/toast primitives
  theme/           color-utils.ts, theme.ts (light/dark/auto), accent, wallpaper
  chat/            chat.ts (ported), markdown.ts, image.ts, conversations.ts
  workspace/       header, model chip menu, settings drawer
  admin/           dashboard, users, groups, providers, models, usage, settings
  auth/            login, register
  styles/          chat.css, workspace.css (ported), admin.css (new, same tokens)
```

The `ui/` primitives are the existing `el()` / `button()` / `icon()` /
`field()` / `checkboxField()` helpers from `chat.js` and `workspace.js`,
lifted into one module instead of being defined twice. The admin backoffice is
built from those plus a generic table — same tokens, same radii, same hover
tint, so it reads as one product.

### Route map

```
/                 chat (redirects to /login when unauthenticated)
/login /register  auth
/settings         user settings (drawer on desktop, page on mobile)
/admin            dashboard
/admin/users      /admin/groups   /admin/providers
/admin/models     /admin/usage    /admin/settings
```

### API surface

```
POST   /api/auth/register           POST /api/auth/login
POST   /api/auth/logout             GET  /api/auth/me
GET    /api/models                  → only what this user may actually use
GET    /api/conversations           POST /api/conversations
GET    /api/conversations/{id}      PATCH /api/conversations/{id}   (title, pin)
DELETE /api/conversations/{id}
POST   /api/chat                    → SSE
POST   /api/attachments             GET  /api/attachments/{id}
GET    /api/usage/me                → current windows, limits, resets_at
GET    /api/preferences             PUT  /api/preferences
PATCH  /api/profile
GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/admin/{users,groups,providers,models}/…
POST   /api/admin/providers/{id}/models/detect
GET    /api/admin/usage             GET/PUT /api/admin/settings
```

## 12. Deployment

Three supported shapes, in order of how the project expects to be run:

**1. A binary.**

```
./obsidian-arc
```

Defaults to SQLite at `./data/obsidian.db` on `:8080`, runs migrations,
creates the first admin from `OBSIDIAN_ADMIN_USER` / `OBSIDIAN_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
on an empty database, and serves the embedded SPA. Nothing else to install,
and nothing required in the environment: a missing `OBSIDIAN_SECRET_KEY` is
generated once into `./data/secret.key` and reused, with a warning saying to
set it explicitly before running a second instance against the same
database.

**2. Docker.** Multi-stage: `node` builds the SPA, `golang` builds the binary
with the SPA embedded, `scratch`/`distroless` runs it. Target image well
under 40 MB.

**3. Docker Compose.** The binary plus a Postgres service, for anyone who
wants it.

Configuration is environment variables with flag overrides, all in
`internal/config`:

```
OBSIDIAN_ADDR              :8080
OBSIDIAN_DB_DRIVER         sqlite | postgres
OBSIDIAN_DB_DSN            ./data/obsidian.db  |  postgres://…
OBSIDIAN_SECRET_KEY        encrypts provider keys; generated into the data
                           directory when unset
OBSIDIAN_SESSION_TTL       720h
OBSIDIAN_TRUST_PROXY       false
OBSIDIAN_LOG_LEVEL         info
```

No Kubernetes assumptions. No init containers, no sidecars, no service mesh.

## 13. Implementation phases

Each phase ends with `go build`, `go vet`, `go test ./...`, `tsc --noEmit`,
a frontend build, and a boot of the server before the next one starts.

| Phase | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Repo layout, `config`, `database` (both drivers), migration runner, `httpx` middleware, embedded SPA serving, Vite/TS scaffold with the existing CSS ported, `main.go` that boots and serves |
| 2 | `auth` (argon2id, sessions, CSRF), `user`, `group`, RBAC middleware, login/register pages, first-admin bootstrap |
| 3 | `provider` (CRUD + key encryption), `model` (CRUD + capabilities + weights), `adapter` package with both adapters and their tests, upstream model detection |
| 4 | `conversation`, `attachments`, `chat` gateway, SSE streaming, cancellation, the chat UI wired to the server — the product works end to end here |
| 5 | `usage` ledger, `quota` policy + atomic counters + enforcement, usage bar in the UI |
| 6 | `admin` module and all seven admin pages |
| 7 | User settings: profile, default model, default reasoning, theme, accent, wallpaper, preference sync |
| 8 | Security pass (CSP, rate limits, redaction, an IDOR sweep), performance pass (indexes, allocation profile, bundle size), Dockerfile, Compose, README, release build |
```
