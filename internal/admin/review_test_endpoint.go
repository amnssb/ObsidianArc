// Trying the sign-up reviewer without registering anything.

// It exists because the question "is the review not working, or is it working
// and being generous" has no other answer from outside: a registration that
// went through looks the same either way. Here an operator types the account
// that got past it and reads what the model actually said.
//
// The reviewer's own reasoning is shown here and nowhere else. This is the
// operator's screen; what a refused visitor sees is still only the message
// the operator wrote.
