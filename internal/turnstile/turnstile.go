// Cloudflare Turnstile, for the two places an anonymous or cheap request
// creates something durable: a new account, and a new API key.
//
// Not a general middleware. A challenge belongs on the handful of endpoints
// where the cost of an automated success is an account or a credential, and
// putting one in front of everything would be a widget in the way of every
// reader for the sake of two forms.
//
// The secret never leaves this process. The site key is public by design —
// it is in the page's markup — and is served with the rest of what the login
// page reads; the secret is write-only in the settings screen and redacted
// out of every response, the same shape a provider's API key has.
