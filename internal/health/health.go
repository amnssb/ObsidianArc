// Whether the models are answering.
//
// Uptime here is contributed by readers first. Every turn anybody takes is
// already written to usage_records with a status and, when it failed, a code
// — real traffic, real prompts, and nothing extra to collect. A model with
// readers therefore has a live figure without this package sending a single
// request of its own.
//
// The gap is a model nobody has used lately. Left alone, its state would be
// "unknown" until somebody tried it, which in practice means an operator
// learns their fallback model has been dead for a week from the reader it
// failed for. So a model with no traffic in the window gets asked directly:
// one message, one token, and the answer is thrown away.
//
// That ordering is the whole design. Probes are what happens when readers are
// not looking, not a second opinion about what they saw.
