// The routing table.
//
// Nine screens and one nested layout, so the table below is the whole of it.
// The two things worth reading are the nesting and the guards.
//
// The nesting: /settings, /keys, /usage and /about are children of `/`, not
// pages of their own, because that is what they are on screen — a column that
// opens beside the conversation, with the chat still behind it. The
// hand-written router had each of those screens call `renderChatPage` first
// and open a panel over the row it returned; expressing it as nesting is the
// same result with the chat mounted once instead of rebuilt four times.
//
// The guards: which pages need a session is one readable list rather than a
// check at the top of each screen. The server enforces the same rules on
// every endpoint regardless — this only decides what to draw.
//
// Only the backoffice is loaded lazily, and everything else is imported
// statically on purpose. Route-level splitting sounds free and is not: the
// panels below are columns over a chat that is already on screen, so a chunk
// per panel buys a round trip in the middle of a click and saves bytes
// nobody was going to avoid downloading anyway. The backoffice is different —
// it is a quarter of the application's code and most accounts can never
// reach it.
